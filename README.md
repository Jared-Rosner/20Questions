# 20Questions
-------------

Authors: Jared Rosner, Eric Last
Instructions: Run Skeleton.py to play. In-game instructions are included.

Description: After completing my first CS course at UC Berkeley, I thought it might be fun to make a simple 20 Questions game using
python. Running Skeleton.py will start a 20-Questions game with potential answers stored in the Answers.txt file and questions stored in 
the Questions.txt file. Although the current answer and question databases only cover generic animals, the Skeleton code will work with
much larger databases. The program chooses which question is asked through a binary search method and supplies the question that most
evenly splits the asnwers into "yes" and "no" groups to minimize the number of questions asked. This is my first CS project for fun so
please let me know what you think and how I can potentially improve it!
